# PHP-Practice-Project-LAMP-Stack-
Linux/Apache/MySql/PHP stack practice code, with an emphasis on learning and practicing PHP.

This project involves re-factoring the Python code to PHP for my Metals Catalog app (in other repository).

Linux, a MySQL server, and Apache2 are required to run this code.
